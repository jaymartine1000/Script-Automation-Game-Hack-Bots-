# AQWorlds GrimoireBot Automation

This repository contains automation flows I designed for AQWorlds using structured command sequences.
Each bot includes:
- a human-readable `flow.txt` explaining the logic  
- the full configuration file used by the automation engine  

These examples demonstrate loops, labels, branching, inventory checks, and multi-step task pipelines.
