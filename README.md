# AQWorlds Grimoire Bot Automation

This repository contains automation scripts I designed for AQWorlds, a MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game), using structured command sequences.
Each bot directory includes:
- a human-readable flow.txt file explaining the logic  
- the full config.json configuration file used by the automation engine  

These examples demonstrate loops, labels, branching, inventory checks, and multi-step task pipelines.
